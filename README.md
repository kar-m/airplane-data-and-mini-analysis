# airplane-data-and-mini-analysis
The data for this notebook was taken from the website http://www.planecrashinfo.com/
<br>
In this notebook we scrape data from many sub-websites using pandas' included read_html() function. Then we clean the data and finally perform a small analysis and come to a conclusion about how data can be manipulated to misrepresent reality.
